            <h2>what other competition are doing wrong</h2>
            <p>what most others are doing is putting the wrong code into areas where they dont need to be and dont exaclty know where to put it. or in other cases they put it in the wrong file and cant find it. it can be confusing at first but in all those are the most common thing that others get wrong</p>
